<h2>What is Web Development? How do I start?</h2>
Web development is very intricate with many components. But to put it simply: it's the design of websites, from front-end, to back-end and even full-stack development. <br></br>
It's easy to get started! There's many ways that you can start, but one thing you should know is the main thing you need is an IDE. An IDE is something you need to write code. The one I use is called Visual Studio Code, which is very popular among developers. It can be downloaded <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target = "_blank"> here</a>. I'm creating my website using an extension called "Live Server", which allows me to open my code locally in a browser and observe changes in real-time.<br></br>
One very important thing you'll need to know is how to...well, construct the components of a website using HTML & CSS! My source for learning the basics is from both <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css" target = "_blank"> Codecademy </a> and a YouTube channel called <a href = "https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?feature=shared" target = "_blank"> Bro Code</a>, which can be found at their respective hyperlinks.

<h2>What is Git & GitHub?</h2>
<a href = "https://git-scm.com/downloads" target ="_blank"> Git </a> is a software called a "version control system" (VCS) that is installed onto the developer's device, it is used to track changes made during development and can be used on its own. It is also easier to revert changes that will not affect the original file(s) by creating different branches.
<br></br>
<a href = "https://github.com/" target = "_blank"> GitHub </a> is a web service owned by Microsoft, it can be used as a tool to complement Git and is used as for its source code repository in order to track changes in a wider team. It can also be installed via <a href = "https://desktop.github.com/" target = "_blank"> GitHub Desktop </a> for convenience in pushing changes onto your repository with your selected IDE.
<br></br>
Overall, both Git and GitHub are typically used hand-in-hand when it comes to most aspects of programming, such as web development and software engineering.

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Branch</b>: Branches are sets of code changes with different names, which make it easier to separate your code without affecting other parts of it. They are essential for collaboration.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Clone</b>: Cloning is just a way to create a duplicate version of a specific repository or branch in order to not affect the main one. When you clone a repository, you also gain access to the entire history of the repository.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Commit</b>: A commit is a point in coding where you can save a specific version with a comment on what changes were made. You can easily revert to any "commit" at any time.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Fetch</b>: It's a command used to grab and download from any remote repository.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>GIT</b>: It's a VCS that is used to track changes made to code.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Github</b>: A web service that allows for collaboration between developers.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Merge</b>: As the name suggests, it's a way for another person's code/branch to merge onto yours.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Merge Conflict</b>: When merging, a merge conflict will appear when two different codes try to merge into one program at once. You will then need to decide which merge will make it into the final code.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Push</b>: It's used to push changes from a local repository onto a remote repository, typically with the same name.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Pull</b>: This is the opposite of pushing, instead of pushing changes, it pulls changes from a remote repository onto your local one.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Remote</b>: A remote repository is a version of your repository stored somewhere online or on another device.</li>
<br></br>
<li><b>Repository</b>: A repository is where all of your code is located.</li>
